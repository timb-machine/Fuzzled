2.1 - 2.2

* Reorganised source tree
* Added doc/AUTHORS

1.1 - 2.1

Midway through developing Fuzzled 2.0, a decision to throw away a substantial
portion of the pre-2.0 code base including substantial portions of the 1.1-2.0
update. Specicially the Fuzzled::Object::* implementation, support for various
protocols and fuzzers that relied upon it. As part of this process, the CVS
repository was reseeded using the following components from the planned 2.0
release:

* Fuzzled::Factory::BruteForce
* Fuzzled::Factory::Date
* Fuzzled::Factory::Increment
* Fuzzled::Factory::Pad
* Fuzzled::Factory::Pattern
* Fuzzled::Factory::QuickBruteForce
* Fuzzled::Factory::Repeat
* Fuzzled::Factory::Replace
* Fuzzled::Namespace::EndLine
* Fuzzled::Namespace::Filename
* Fuzzled::Namespace::FormatString
* Fuzzled::Namespace::Javascript
* Fuzzled::Namespace::LDAP
* Fuzzled::Namespace::LettersUpper
* Fuzzled::Namespace::Numbers
* Fuzzled::Namespace::Printable
* Fuzzled::Namespace::Separate
* Fuzzled::Namespace::Shell
* Fuzzled::Namespace::SQL
* Fuzzled::Namespace::Unicode
* Fuzzled::Namespace::URLEncoded
* Fuzzled::Namespace::Whitespace

These components are collectively known as Fuzzled 2.1. Fuzzled 3.0 will
consist of a complete rewrite of previously rewritten code. All previously
written code has been archived and portions /may/ find their way into Fuzzled
3.0 where suitable.
